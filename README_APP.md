#deatiled explanation of the file named "APP".
The code creates a Streamlit web application that allows users to interact with a chatbot enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The chatbot can answer questions based on the content of uploaded PDF files. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each part of the code:

Imports and Setup

import databutton as db
import streamlit as st
import openai
from brain import get_index_for_pdf
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIyt
import os
databutton as db: For managing secrets and other functionalities from the Databutton platform.
streamlit as st: For building the web interface.
openai: For interacting with OpenAI's API.
get_index_for_pdf: A custom function to create a searchable vector index from PDF files.
RetrievalQA and ChatOpenAI: For handling the retrieval-augmented question-answering process.
os: For accessing environment variables.
Streamlit App Title and API Key Setup

"st.title("RAG enhanced Chatbot")"

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = db.secrets.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
openai.api_key = db.secrets.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
Sets the title of the Streamlit app.
Retrieves the OpenAI API key from Databutton secrets and sets it as an environment variable and in the openai module.
Cached Function for Creating the Vector Database

@st.cache_data
def create_vectordb(files, filenames):
    with st.spinner("Vector database"):
        vectordb = get_index_for_pdf(
            [file.getvalue() for file in files], filenames, openai.api_key
        )
    return vectordb
@st.cache_data: Caches the function result to optimize performance by preventing re-execution with the same inputs.
create_vectordb: This function takes uploaded PDF files and their filenames, creates a vector database using the get_index_for_pdf function, and returns the database.
File Upload Interface

pdf_files = st.file_uploader("", type="pdf", accept_multiple_files=True)

if pdf_files:
    pdf_file_names = [file.name for file in pdf_files]
    st.session_state["vectordb"] = create_vectordb(pdf_files, pdf_file_names)
st.file_uploader: A Streamlit widget that allows users to upload multiple PDF files.
If files are uploaded, their names are extracted and the create_vectordb function is called to create a vector database, which is then stored in the session state.
Chatbot Prompt Template

prompt_template = """
    You are a helpful Assistant who answers to users questions based on multiple contexts given to you.

    Keep your answer short and to the point.
    
    The evidence are the context of the pdf extract with metadata. 
    
    Carefully focus on the metadata specially 'filename' and 'page' whenever answering.
    
    Make sure to add filename and page number at the end of sentence you are citing to.
        
    Reply "Not applicable" if text is irrelevant.
     
    The PDF content is:
    {pdf_extract}
"""
A template for the system prompt that guides the assistant on how to use the PDF content to answer questions, emphasizing metadata inclusion.
Session State and Previous Messages

prompt = st.session_state.get("prompt", [{"role": "system", "content": "none"}])

for message in prompt:
    if message["role"] != "system":
        with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
            st.write(message["content"])
Retrieves the chat prompt history from the session state or initializes it with a default system message.
Displays previous chat messages, excluding the system message.
User Question Handling

question = st.chat_input("Ask anything")

if question:
    vectordb = st.session_state.get("vectordb", None)
    if not vectordb:
        with st.message("assistant"):
            st.write("You need to provide a PDF")
            st.stop()
st.chat_input: A widget for user input.
If a question is provided, the code checks if the vector database exists in the session state. If not, it prompts the user to upload a PDF and stops execution.
Searching the Vector Database and Updating the Prompt

    search_results = vectordb.similarity_search(question, k=3)
    pdf_extract = "/n ".join([result.page_content for result in search_results])

    prompt[0] = {
        "role": "system",
        "content": prompt_template.format(pdf_extract=pdf_extract),
    }

    prompt.append({"role": "user", "content": question})
    with st.chat_message("user"):
        st.write(question)
similarity_search: Searches the vector database for content similar to the user's question.
Combines the search results into a single string.
Updates the system prompt with the retrieved PDF content.
Adds the user's question to the prompt and displays it.
Generating and Displaying the Assistant's Response

    with st.chat_message("assistant"):
        botmsg = st.empty()

    response = []
    result = ""
    for chunk in openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=prompt, stream=True
    ):
        text = chunk.choices[0].get("delta", {}).get("content")
        if text is not None:
            response.append(text)
            result = "".join(response).strip()
            botmsg.write(result)

    prompt.append({"role": "assistant", "content": result})
    st.session_state["prompt"] = prompt
Displays an empty message for the assistant while waiting for the response.
Calls the OpenAI API with streaming to generate the assistant's response.
As the response is streamed, it is continuously updated and displayed.
Adds the assistant's response to the prompt and updates the session state.
Summary
The code sets up a Streamlit app that:

Allows users to upload PDF files.
Creates a vector database from the uploaded PDFs for similarity search.
Takes user questions, searches the PDF content for relevant information, and uses this information to generate answers with OpenAI's GPT model.
Displays the conversation history and dynamically updates with new user questions and assistant responses.
This creates an interactive, retrieval-augmented chatbot that can provide answers based on the content of the uploaded PDF files.
